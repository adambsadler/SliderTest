# SliderTest

**By Adam Sadler**

I developed this application as part of a job application process. I was instructed to write an iOS app in Swift using SwiftUI that pulls data from a REST API. The App displays a slider, which the user can use buttons to manipulaute and select a value. The selected value is then used for another POST request that gets the next test to display to the user. After 3 tests, the final view displays all the selections for the user and allows them to restart the test.
